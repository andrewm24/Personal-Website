# Personal Website

This repository contains a simple, single-page HTML site for Andrew Makarevich. The layout is intentionally
minimal and avoids binary assets so it can be hosted anywhere without extra build steps.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in a browser or serve the directory with any static file server, such as:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`.

## Customizing

Edit the content directly in `index.html` and adjust the basic styling in `style.css`. If you want to include
images, videos, or downloadable files, create a directory such as `assets/` and reference them from the HTML.
Keep in mind that large binaries are optional and not required for the bare-bones version of the site.
